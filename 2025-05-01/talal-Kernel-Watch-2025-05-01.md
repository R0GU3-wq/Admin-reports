### CWE Analysis

#### CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (Exploitability: 7)
- **Issue**: The code contains a logic flaw in how file size changes (especially shrinking operations indicated by the `shrink` variable) interact with the `ext4_fc_track_range` function. This function is used to track file extent changes for fast commits in journaling.  Specifically, the code calls `ext4_fc_track_range` with potentially very large or incorrect ranges, especially when shrinking files and when `attr->ia_size` is set to zero. In the shrink branch, the start block is calculated based on `attr->ia_size`, and the end block is set to EXT_MAX_BLOCKS - 1. When attr->ia_size is 0, the start block becomes -1 >> inode->i_sb->s_blocksize_bits. This could result in a very large positive number, attempting to track an extremely wide range of blocks, possibly leading to excessive memory consumption or performance degradation.  This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by exhausting memory or slowing down the system.

- CVE-2025-39735: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jfs: fix slab-out-of-bounds read in ea_get()

During the "size_check" label in ea_get(), the code checks if the extended
attribute list (xattr) size matches ea_size. If not, it logs
"ea_get: invalid extended attribute" and calls print_hex_dump().

Here, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr) returns 4110417968, which exceeds
INT_MAX (2,147,483,647). Then ea_size is clamped:

	int size = clamp_t(int, ea_size, 0, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr));

Although clamp_t aims to bound ea_size between 0 and 4110417968, the upper
limit is treated as an int, causing an overflow above 2^31 - 1. This leads
"size" to wrap around and become negative (-184549328).

The "size" is then passed to print_hex_dump() (called "len" in
print_hex_dump()), it is passed as type size_t (an unsigned
type), this is then stored inside a variable called
"int remaining", which is then assigned to "int linelen" which
is then passed to hex_dump_to_buffer(). In print_hex_dump()
the for loop, iterates through 0 to len-1, where len is
18446744073525002176, calling hex_dump_to_buffer()
on each iteration:

	for (i = 0; i < len; i += rowsize) {
		linelen = min(remaining, rowsize);
		remaining -= rowsize;

		hex_dump_to_buffer(ptr + i, linelen, rowsize, groupsize,
				   linebuf, sizeof(linebuf), ascii);

		...
	}

The expected stopping condition (i < len) is effectively broken
since len is corrupted and very large. This eventually leads to
the "ptr+i" being passed to hex_dump_to_buffer() to get closer
to the end of the actual bounds of "ptr", eventually an out of
bounds access is done in hex_dump_to_buffer() in the following
for loop:

	for (j = 0; j < len; j++) {
			if (linebuflen < lx + 2)
				goto overflow2;
			ch = ptr[j];
		...
	}

To fix this we should validate "EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr)"
before it is utilised. (Similarity: 55)
- CVE-2025-37785: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix OOB read when checking dotdot dir

Mounting a corrupted filesystem with directory which contains '.' dir
entry with rec_len == block size results in out-of-bounds read (later
on, when the corrupted directory is removed).

ext4_empty_dir() assumes every ext4 directory contains at least '.'
and '..' as directory entries in the first data block. It first loads
the '.' dir entry, performs sanity checks by calling ext4_check_dir_entry()
and then uses its rec_len member to compute the location of '..' dir
entry (in ext4_next_entry). It assumes the '..' dir entry fits into the
same data block.

If the rec_len of '.' is precisely one block (4KB), it slips through the
sanity checks (it is considered the last directory entry in the data
block) and leaves "struct ext4_dir_entry_2 *de" point exactly past the
memory slot allocated to the data block. The following call to
ext4_check_dir_entry() on new value of de then dereferences this pointer
which results in out-of-bounds mem access.

Fix this by extending __ext4_check_dir_entry() to check for '.' dir
entries that reach the end of data block. Make sure to ignore the phony
dir entries for checksum (by checking name_len for non-zero).

Note: This is reported by KASAN as use-after-free in case another
structure was recently freed from the slot past the bound, but it is
really an OOB read.

This issue was found by syzkaller tool.

- CVE-2025-22055: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: fix geneve_opt length integer overflow

struct geneve_opt uses 5 bit length for each single option, which
means every vary size option should be smaller than 128 bytes.

However, all current related Netlink policies cannot promise this
length condition and the attacker can exploit a exact 128-byte size
option to *fake* a zero length option and confuse the parsing logic,
further achieve heap out-of-bounds read.

#### CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Exploitability: 7)
- **Issue**: The code calculates the number of pages required for the mapping using `len >> PAGE_SHIFT`. This value is then added to `pgoff`. If `pgoff + (len >> PAGE_SHIFT)` exceeds the maximum value of its data type (likely `unsigned long`), an integer overflow occurs. This overflow could wrap around to a small value, causing the check `(pgoff + (len >> PAGE_SHIFT)) < pgoff` to pass even when it should fail. This can lead to an attacker mapping a large region of memory at an unexpected address or overlapping with existing mappings. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities like privilege escalation if sensitive data is overwritten.

md/md-bitmap: fix wrong bitmap_limit for clustermd when write sb

In clustermd, separate write-intent-bitmaps are used for each cluster
node:

0                    4k                     8k                    12k
-------------------------------------------------------------------
| idle                | md super            | bm super [0] + bits |
| bm bits[0, contd]   | bm super[1] + bits  | bm bits[1, contd]   |
| bm super[2] + bits  | bm bits [2, contd]  | bm super[3] + bits  |
| bm bits [3, contd]  |                     |                     |

So in node 1, pg_index in __write_sb_page() could equal to
bitmap->storage.file_pages. Then bitmap_limit will be calculated to
0. md_super_write() will be called with 0 size.
That means the first 4k sb area of node 1 will never be updated
through filemap_write_page().
This bug causes hang of mdadm/clustermd_tests/01r1_Grow_resize.

Here use (pg_index % bitmap->storage.file_pages) to make calculation
of bitmap_limit correct. (Similarity: 49)

net: dsa: sja1105: fix kasan out-of-bounds warning in sja1105_table_delete_entry()

There are actually 2 problems:
- deleting the last element doesn't require the memmove of elements
  [i + 1, end) over it. Actually, element i+1 is out of bounds.
- The memmove itself should move size - i - 1 elements, because the last
  element is out of bounds.

The out-of-bounds element still remains out of bounds after being
accessed, so the problem is only that we touch it, not that it becomes
in active use. But I suppose it can lead to issues if the out-of-bounds
element is part of an unmapped page. (Similarity: 49)


#### CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (Exploitability: 6)
- **Issue**: The code checks for resource limits such as RLIMIT_NPROC (maximum number of processes) using `is_rlimit_overlimit`. However, the subsequent check using `data_race(nr_threads >= max_threads)` is likely a race condition where `nr_threads` could increment between the rlimit check and the `data_race` check. Specifically, even if `is_rlimit_overlimit` passes, another process could create a thread, incrementing `nr_threads`, and then `data_race(nr_threads >= max_threads)` might still pass, leading to more threads than `max_threads`. Although the `data_race` macro is intended to provide some protection, race conditions around resource limits can lead to denial-of-service (DoS) conditions. Specifically, the system could become overloaded with threads, impacting performance or even leading to a crash.

#### CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Exploitability: 7)
- **Issue**: The code checks if the sum of `to_shinfo->nr_frags` and `from_shinfo->nr_frags` is greater than or equal to `MAX_SKB_FRAGS`. However, if `to_shinfo->nr_frags` or `from_shinfo->nr_frags` is sufficiently large, their sum can wrap around, leading to a value smaller than `MAX_SKB_FRAGS`, thus bypassing the check. This could allow exceeding the maximum number of fragments allowed in an sk_buff.  If too many fragments are added, subsequent operations relying on a valid fragment array or related data structures can result in out-of-bounds access or memory corruption. This can lead to a denial of service or potentially a privilege escalation if the corrupted data structures control sensitive kernel operations.

tomoyo: don't emit warning in tomoyo_write_control()

syzbot is reporting too large allocation warning at tomoyo_write_control(),
for one can write a very very long line without new line character. To fix
this warning, I use __GFP_NOWARN rather than checking for KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE,
for practically a valid line should be always shorter than 32KB where the
"too small to fail" memory-allocation rule applies.

One might try to write a valid line that is longer than 32KB, but such
request will likely fail with -ENOMEM. Therefore, I feel that separately
returning -EINVAL when a line is longer than KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE is redundant.
There is no need to distinguish over-32KB and over-KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE. (Similarity: 57)

When mb-xdp is set and return is XDP_PASS, packet is converted from
xdp_buff to sk_buff with xdp_update_skb_shared_info() in
bnxt_xdp_build_skb().
bnxt_xdp_build_skb() passes incorrect truesize argument to
xdp_update_skb_shared_info().
The truesize is calculated as BNXT_RX_PAGE_SIZE * sinfo->nr_frags but
the skb_shared_info was wiped by napi_build_skb() before.
So it stores sinfo->nr_frags before bnxt_xdp_build_skb() and use it
instead of getting skb_shared_info from xdp_get_shared_info_from_buff().

#### CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Exploitability: 7)
- **Issue**: The code defines `obj_offset_t` as an `unsigned int`.  It then uses `OBJ_OFFSET_MASK` as `((obj_offset_t)~0U)`. This represents the maximum value for an `unsigned int`.  While not directly present in the snippet, if `obj_offset` within `kmem_cache` structure is later used in calculations involving addition or multiplication, and there are insufficient checks on the values or the results of these calculations, it could lead to an integer overflow or wraparound. For instance, multiplying `obj_offset` with another variable and then using the result to access an array could cause an out-of-bounds read or write, leading to a denial of service or, in some circumstances, code execution. An integer overflow could occur if `size` is also close to the maximum integer size, where `size` is derived from multiplication or addition involving `obj_offset`. Even though the code only defines data types, without proper validation on the `size` and `obj_offset` when creating `kmem_cache` objects, integer overflows may occur during memory allocation or object addressing, leading to heap corruption or memory access errors.

- CVE-2025-21724: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommufd/iova_bitmap: Fix shift-out-of-bounds in iova_bitmap_offset_to_index()

Resolve a UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds issue in iova_bitmap_offset_to_index()
where shifting the constant "1" (of type int) by bitmap->mapped.pgshift
(an unsigned long value) could result in undefined behavior.

The constant "1" defaults to a 32-bit "int", and when "pgshift" exceeds
31 (e.g., pgshift = 63) the shift operation overflows, as the result
cannot be represented in a 32-bit type.

To resolve this, the constant is updated to "1UL", promoting it to an
unsigned long type to match the operand's type. (Similarity: 53)


#### CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management (Exploitability: 8)
- **Issue**: The `__sys_setresuid` function allows a process to change its real, effective, and saved user IDs. The vulnerability lies in the checks performed before allowing the ID change, specifically at line 1135 `!ns_capable_setid(old->user_ns, CAP_SETUID)`. While the code checks for `CAP_SETUID` capability in the user namespace, it only checks against the *old* credentials (`old->user_ns`).  If a process has gained `CAP_SETUID` in a different user namespace (e.g., through a setuid binary or other means) and then enters another user namespace where it *doesn't* have `CAP_SETUID` in its current credentials, this check will erroneously pass if the old credentials had the capability.  This allows a non-privileged process in a new user namespace to set its user IDs to arbitrary values, potentially escalating privileges within that namespace. The impact is significant, as it bypasses the intended restrictions on user ID manipulation, potentially leading to privilege escalation within the user namespace, container escape, or arbitrary code execution.

- CVE-2025-21846: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

acct: perform last write from workqueue

In [1] it was reported that the acct(2) system call can be used to
trigger NULL deref in cases where it is set to write to a file that
triggers an internal lookup. This can e.g., happen when pointing acc(2)
to /sys/power/resume. At the point the where the write to this file
happens the calling task has already exited and called exit_fs(). A
lookup will thus trigger a NULL-deref when accessing current->fs.

Reorganize the code so that the the final write happens from the
workqueue but with the caller's credentials. This preserves the
(strange) permission model and has almost no regression risk.

This api should stop to exist though. (Similarity: 54)

exec: fix the racy usage of fs_struct->in_exec

check_unsafe_exec() sets fs->in_exec under cred_guard_mutex, then execve()
paths clear fs->in_exec lockless. This is fine if exec succeeds, but if it
fails we have the following race:

	T1 sets fs->in_exec = 1, fails, drops cred_guard_mutex

	T2 sets fs->in_exec = 1

	T1 clears fs->in_exec

	T2 continues with fs->in_exec == 0

                    inode->i_sb->s_blocksize_bits);
        }
```

**Reasoning:**

The original code had a potential vulnerability in the `shrink` branch when `attr->ia_size` was 0. In this case, the start block was calculated as `(attr->ia_size > 0 ? attr->ia_size - 1 : 0) >> inode->i_sb->s_blocksize_bits`, which simplifies to `(0 - 1) >> inode->i_sb->s_blocksize_bits`. This results in `-1 >> inode->i_sb->s_blocksize_bits`, which, due to the signed right shift, results in a large positive number. This large value is then passed as the starting block to `ext4_fc_track_range`, causing excessive memory consumption and potential DoS.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by explicitly checking if `attr->ia_size` is 0. If it is, `start_block` is set to 0. Otherwise, the original calculation for `start_block` is performed. This prevents the large positive number from being used when shrinking files to a size of zero. This change maintains the intended functionality of tracking the relevant file extent changes for fast commits.

There are no significant trade-offs with this change. It adds a simple check to avoid an incorrect calculation, and it only affects the specific case where the file is shrunk to size 0.

```

Reasoning:

The original code checked for overflow using `(pgoff + (len >> PAGE_SHIFT)) < pgoff`.  This check only works if the addition overflows and wraps around to a smaller value than `pgoff`.  However, if the result of the addition equals `pgoff` due to wraparound, this check will not detect the overflow, leading to potential memory corruption.

The corrected code directly checks if `(len >> PAGE_SHIFT)` is greater than the maximum possible value that can be added to `pgoff` without causing an overflow. We are checking if `(len >> PAGE_SHIFT) > ULONG_MAX - pgoff`. If this is true, adding `(len >> PAGE_SHIFT)` to `pgoff` will result in an overflow. This approach eliminates the possibility of missing the overflow and provides a reliable overflow check. `ULONG_MAX` is included from `linux/kernel.h` and `PAGE_SHIFT` is included from `linux/page.h` to ensure correct functionality and portability. This also avoids any reliance on compiler-specific behavior. The functionality of the surrounding code remains identical.

**Reasoning:**

The core issue is the potential race condition between the `is_rlimit_overlimit` check and the `data_race(nr_threads >= max_threads)` check.  A new thread could be created *after* `is_rlimit_overlimit` passes, but *before* the `data_race` check is performed.  This would increment `nr_threads` such that `nr_threads >= max_threads` becomes true when it otherwise would have been false.  By swapping the order of the checks, we ensure that `nr_threads` is checked *before* `is_rlimit_overlimit`.  If `nr_threads >= max_threads`, we exit early. If `nr_threads < max_threads` when checked, then we proceed with the `is_rlimit_overlimit` check.

Specifically:
1. **Vulnerability Resolution:** Moving the `data_race(nr_threads >= max_threads)` check *before* the `is_rlimit_overlimit` check significantly reduces the window for the race condition. If the maximum number of threads has already been reached, the fork is aborted regardless of the rlimit.
2. **Functionality Preservation:**  The change preserves the code's functionality by ensuring that both the thread count limit and the rlimit are still enforced. We simply enforce the thread count limit *before* the rlimit. This will not change the overall behavior in cases without race conditions, and in cases with race conditions will prevent the creation of more threads than intended.
3. **Trade-offs/Considerations:** There are no significant trade-offs.  The reordering does not negatively impact performance.  The code's intent is maintained; resource limits are still enforced, but in a safer order. In the rare cases where the race condition existed, the thread creation will be prevented, so this patch will only change the functionality in exceptional cases, consistent with the design of the code.
4. The code change is kept to a bare minimum, only reordering the checks and adding a comment to clearly document the rationale.

        return false;

    if (skb_headlen(from) != 0) {
        struct page *page;
        unsigned int offset;

        if (to_shinfo->nr_frags > MAX_SKB_FRAGS - from_shinfo->nr_frags)
            return false;

        if (skb_head_is_locked(from))
            return false;

        delta = from->truesize - SKB_DATA_ALIGN(sizeof(struct sk_buff));

        page = virt_to_head_page(from->head);
        offset = from->data - (unsigned char *)page_address(page);

        skb_fill_page_desc(to, to_shinfo->nr_frags,
                           page, offset, skb_headlen(from));
        *fragstolen = true;
    }
```

Reasoning:

The original code had an integer overflow vulnerability when checking if the number of fragments would exceed `MAX_SKB_FRAGS`. Adding `to_shinfo->nr_frags` and `from_shinfo->nr_frags` could wrap around, resulting in a value smaller than `MAX_SKB_FRAGS`, even if the actual sum would exceed it.

The patch replaces the vulnerable check `to_shinfo->nr_frags + from_shinfo->nr_frags >= MAX_SKB_FRAGS` with `to_shinfo->nr_frags > MAX_SKB_FRAGS - from_shinfo->nr_frags`. This rearrangement avoids integer overflow by subtracting `from_shinfo->nr_frags` from `MAX_SKB_FRAGS` first. If the result is smaller than `to_shinfo->nr_frags`, it means their sum would have exceeded `MAX_SKB_FRAGS`, and the function returns `false`. This effectively prevents the integer overflow and ensures that the number of fragments never exceeds the maximum allowed.

The patch maintains the original code's functionality by performing the same check regarding the maximum number of allowed fragments. The rearranged check is logically equivalent to the original check without the integer overflow issue. There are no trade-offs; this change simply corrects a flawed check.

```

**Reasoning:**

The original code defines `obj_offset_t` and `OBJ_OFFSET_MASK` which, while not directly overflowing, contribute to a potential integer overflow vulnerability during the later use of `obj_offset` in calculations. Specifically, if `obj_offset` or `size` (object size) is close to the maximum value of unsigned int, a multiplication of these variables could lead to a wraparound, and this wraparound could cause an out-of-bounds read/write.

The patch addresses this by providing an inline function `kmem_cache_overflow` which takes the `objsize`, `objoffset` and `slabsize` as input and checks for an overflow condition. The function first checks for multiplication overflow by ensuring the division cancels out to the original size, if the condition is false, it means overflow has occured. It also checks if the product of the two is greater than the slabsize, indicating an out of bounds access later when this multiplication is used as an offset.  Introducing this inline function and calling it during `kmem_cache` creation will resolve the integer overflow vulnerability. We also add `slab_size` to `kmem_cache` struct which will be passed to `kmem_cache_overflow`.

Adding `slab_size` inside `kmem_cache` struct:
*   Maintains the code's functionality: This addition to `kmem_cache` struct is crucial to determine if the slabs are too small, especially when `obj_offset` is close to the upper limit of `unsigned int`. `slab_size` will store the slab size that can then be used to check the total offset.
*   Trade-offs or considerations: Extra 4 bytes of memory usage for each `kmem_cache` object to store the slab size.

Introducing `kmem_cache_overflow`:
*   Addresses Integer Overflow: This inline function checks for any integer overflows if `objsize` * `objoffset` exceeds the slab size, it will return 1.
*   Maintains functionality: Because it is an inline function, there will be little performance impact.
*   Trade-offs or Considerations: A runtime check is added to prevent the integer overflow.
